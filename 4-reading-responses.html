                                      What I learned from the reading is that we just naturally think of the web as something came out of nowhere, even though it’s something that’s constantly changing and evolving. This is largely due to the thought the designers and engineers put into the work. And it’s important to think about what is behind the contents that are present on the surface. But rather think deeper into the code level.<br>

                                      Of course not everyone have to do this. The reason why the web looks like it is today is to help people get more efficient and offer valuable information at a glance. The fonts, layouts, interactions, color ... should all be considered by us the designers and developers.
                                    </p>
                                    </div>

                                      One of the most prominant problems facing modern day developers is to create a website that adapts to the screen the users are looking at.<br>

                                      We are trying so hard to make the web become everything it can possibly be. We changed what is used to present the web; we changed how we interact with them; we changed how it looks, as well as how it behaves.<br>

                                      I guess the most important for me to keep in mind is that everything is changing, especially the ones on the web. They are changing so fast. It's not just we have to constantly adapt to the various trends, but also should we make the site able to adapt to the world in which it exists.

                                      - the web used to be a fascination to the future, about what the web is going to offer us (the universe backdrop). And now it is more like some means of utility, offering us useful information and improving efficiency by reducing to its essence.<br>

                                      - people used to treat internet as something they are all supposed to contribute to (lots of links) the development process.<br>

                                      Today, having a tilde in front of your name is especially problematic because Apple computers don't have it on their keyboard*. To type "~" you have to press Alt and N at the same time then release these keys and hit the spacebar. Even those who know the secret never remember it. This complication makes the old fashioned tilde mysterious and sweet like a forbidden fruit.

                                      "Do you think of yourself as primarily working “on” the digital or primarily “within” it?"<br>

                                      The thinking behind this reading is questioning us whether we see the web as a limitation or foundation. And the introduction of unicode expanded so much upon the perspective.<br>

                                      - In the former, one’s attention is directed from the outside in, taking the medium itself as its object, while in the latter one takes the perspective of the medium itself, radiating attention outward to other contexts and environments. To generalize from this, the first position (working “on”) is labeled modern or, when applied to art and aesthetics, modernist. And the latter position (working “within”) is labeled non-modern, be it premodern, postmodern, or some other alternative.

                                      "Knowledge may mean power, but information often means domination."<br>

                                      When user information is in the hands of those with power and influence, our privacy will be non-existence. However, at the same time, web services need information to better serve the users what they need. Therefore, inspired by the GDPR regulation, I believe we the designers have a role in better informing the users when their data is being collected and used, and how the cooperation is going to manage them. <br>

                                      Web design is not just about intuitive interactions that prompt the users to click on a button. It's also about empowering the users the control over their own privacy.

                                      This article mainly talked about the physical infrastructures of the internet. Similar to the "Capitalism vs. Privacy" article, this article called us the readers' attention toward internet freedom. Through the discussion of internet power concentration and the role of ISPs in maintaining the net neutrality of the internet, the author explains the internet relative to our physical world to us.<br>

                                      However, I do think the graphics and texts overlays, and the scrolling effect itself made it a bit confusing for the readers.

                                      As the Internet develop, we develop with it as well. We should always remember that we're not just the consumer of the Internet, but also its contributer, its builder.<br>

                                      This article once again urges us to transform our relationship with the Internet. According to the author, we shouldn't see the Internet as a kind of medium or content. But rather, as something expansive, competitive, interactive, always-changing, and is made up of a variety of different things.<br>

                                      One of the take-aways I have is that we should develop the Internet as a place full of potential, like a construction site, instead of a plane sheet of paper for us to put words and images on.
